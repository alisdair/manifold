* [ ] Add one more degree of freedom

      The original intent of this game was to allow swiping of rows and columns, as well as the cross-shaped toggle. The problem with this is native touch UI. What can be done with Safari touch events except for tapping?

* [ ] Store/retrieve game state in a URL hash

      This will allow native browser back buttons for undo, as well as sharing of game states between people.

* [ ] Keep game history in localstorage, and allow conceding/replaying of games

      This is an important part of puzzle game structure. There are Freecell users with thousands of games in their history, at 100% success ratio. Any puzzle which can always be solved leads some people to enjoy keeping a perfect record by replaying hard puzzles.

* [ ] Tutorial/ramp up in complexity

      Right now the game is limited in board size and colours to make it clear what is happening. These variables could be increased once people undertand how to play.
